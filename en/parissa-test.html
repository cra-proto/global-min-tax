    <h2 id="howapply">How the GST/HST applies to home construction industry</h2>
    <p>It is important to become familiar with the GST/HST concepts and terms that apply to the home construction industry.</p>
    <p>Generally, you have to charge and collect the GST/HST from a purchaser if you meet <strong>both</strong> of the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are a GST/HST registrant</li>
      <li>You make taxable supplies (other than zero-rated supplies) of property or services in Canada</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="whatsupply">Supplies of construction services and real property are taxed differently</h3>
    <p>Generally, the <span class="nowrap">GST/HST </span>rules for supplies of real property are different from those for supplies of construction services. So, before you can charge and collect the GST/HST, you have to determine if you are supplying construction services <span class="nowrap">(for example,</span> a service of building a house) or real property (for example, selling the house and land).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The following are some of the factors to consider when determining whether you are supplying a construction service or real property:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What does the agreement state that you are providing? If&nbsp;the agreement is a purchase and sale agreement for a new house including the land upon which the house is to&nbsp;be built, you are supplying real property. If the agreement is a contract for construction services only (for&nbsp;example, to build a house on land owned by your customer), you are generally supplying a construction service</li>
      <li>Who owns the land while the construction of the house is in progress?&nbsp;If you own the land while you are constructing the house, this is an indicator that you are supplying real property</li>
      <li>Who is liable to pay the property taxes while the construction is in progress? If you are liable to pay the property taxes directly to the taxing authority, this may be an indicator that you are supplying real property</li>
      <li>Upon completion of the contract, will you transfer the legal title to the real property to the purchaser?&nbsp;If you transfer legal title to the property, you are supplying real property</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are also supplying real property if you lease or licence real property to another person, or if you sell or assign an interest in real property.</p>
    <p>For more information on how to determine if you are supplying property or a construction service, see paragraphs 95 <span class="nowrap">to 97</span> of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/19-1.html">GST/HST Memorandum 19.1, Real Property and the GST/HST</a>.<span style="font-size: 0.8125rem;">.</span><br>

    <h2 id="builderscharge"><strong>When do builders&nbsp;have to&nbsp;charge&nbsp;the GST/HST</strong></h2>
    <p>The GST/HST generally applies to the sale of new or substantially renovated housing.</p>
    <p>All&nbsp;builders have to charge&nbsp;the GST/HST on their taxable sales of new or substantially renovated housing. Generally, if the&nbsp;purchaser is not an individual, the purchaser's GST/HST registration status may&nbsp;determine whether the builder collects and remits the GST/HST on the taxable sale. For more information on collecting and remitting the tax, see <a href="#determine">Determining if the vendor or purchaser collects and remits the GST/HST</a>.</p>
    <p>Builders who are registrants may be able to claim <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#itc">input tax credits</a> (ITCs) to recover GST/HST they paid on the goods and services used in the construction or substantial renovation of the housing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3>Making a self-supply</h3>
    <p>The GST/HST applies to self-supplies of new or substantially renovated housing. The term self-supply describes a situation where a builder is considered to have both made a supply by way of sale of real property and, at the same time, to have repurchased that property.</p>
    <p>Self-supply rules may apply to builders of new or substantially renovated housing, whether or not they are GST/HST registrants.</p>

    <h3>Building a home for someone</h3>
    <p>If you (as a GST/HST registrant) are hired by someone to build or substantially renovate housing on land that they own, or have an interest in, you must charge and collect GST/HST from them on the labour and materials you provide when building or substantially renovating the housing.</p>
    <p>Owners of new or substantially renovated housing may qualify for a GST/HST new housing rebate for a portion of&nbsp;the GST/HST&nbsp;paid on labour and materials, but they must apply for the rebate. Service contractors cannot pay or credit&nbsp;the GST/HST&nbsp;new housing rebate to home owners, nor can they&nbsp;apply for the GST/HST new housing rebate on behalf of home owners.</p>

  <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3>Renovating a house (other than substantial renovations)</h3>
    <p>If you are a contractor or a real estate developer and you renovate a house that you bought in the course of your business, special rules apply if the renovation is not considered to be a substantial renovation.</p>
    <p>In this case, you have to remit the GST/HST on certain untaxed costs (other than financial services), such as employee labour costs involved in renovating the housing. You calculate the GST/HST based on the value of the amount paid or payable on such untaxed costs. This rule does not apply to input costs (for example, material or contracted services) on which GST/HST has already been paid.</p>
    <p>The sale or lease of a house after a non-substantial renovation is generally exempt from GST/HST. You cannot claim ITCs to recover the GST/HST paid on the goods and services used in the renovation of the house. The purchaser cannot claim a GST/HST new housing rebate on the purchase of the house.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="rate"><strong>GST/HST rates for the sale of housing</strong></h2>
    <p>In general, the GST/HST rates for taxable sales of housing are based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the province where the real property is located</li>
      <li>the GST/HST rate in effect in that province on the day that the tax becomes payable for the sale, which is generally the <strong>earlier</strong> of:
        <ul>
          <li>the day that ownership of the property is transferred</li>
          <li>the day that possession of the property is transferred under the agreement for the sale</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This rule for determining the day that tax becomes payable for the sale&nbsp;may <strong>not</strong> apply to certain taxable sales of residential condominium units.</p>

      <summary>Deposits </summary>
      <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
        <p>For GST/HST purposes, a deposit is an amount given by a&nbsp;purchaser as security for the performance of a future obligation.</p>
        <p>If you are a vendor who collects a deposit from a purchaser for a taxable supply of property or services that you will make, the deposit is not considered to be a payment until you apply it as a payment toward the amount the purchaser owes you for the taxable supply, or until the purchaser forfeits the deposit because of a modification, violation, or cancellation of the agreement. This&nbsp;applies whether the deposit is refundable or not.</p>
        <h4>Deposit applied as a payment&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>The GST/HST is payable on the day you apply the deposit as a payment.</p>
        <h4>Deposit forfeited by purchaser&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>When the purchaser forfeits the deposit because of a breach, modification or termination of the agreement, the deposit amount is considered to include the GST/HST. You have to report the tax collected on your GST/HST return for the reporting period in which the deposited amount was forfeited.</p>
        <p>To calculate the amount of GST/HST included in a forfeited deposit, multiply the forfeited deposit by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5/105 if the supply is subject to GST at 5%</li>
          <li>13/113 if the supply is subject to the HST at 13%</li>
          <li>15/115 if the supply is subject to the HST at 15%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Purchasers who forfeit their deposits are considered to&nbsp;have paid the GST/HST. As a result, purchasers who are registrants may be eligible to claim input tax credits for the GST/HST included in their forfeited amounts.</p>

      <summary>Construction contracts and progress payments </summary>
      <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
        <p>When construction extends over a period of time, the written contract often calls for the purchaser to make progress payments as the work proceeds. These payments are not deposits. They are usually for work completed, but they can also be made in anticipation of work being completed. Payments made for a sale of real property are not progress payments.</p>
        <p>Generally, the GST/HST becomes payable on each progress payment on the <strong>earlier</strong> of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the day the purchaser pays the progress payment</li>
          <li>the day the progress payment becomes due</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Value of work completed</h4>
        <p>Your contract may state that a supplier (for example, a contractor) can request a payment from you based on the value of work completed. In this case, another person, usually a consultant, an engineer or an architect, has to approve the work and issue a certificate stating the value of the work completed. Generally, you have to make the payment within a certain number of days after the consultant, engineer or architect issues the certificate.</p>
        <p>In this situation, the supplier's request or application for payment is&nbsp;not considered to be an invoice, because it is only a request to assess the work completed and issue a certificate for payment according to the contract. The GST/HST does not become payable at the time of the request or application.</p>
        <p>The GST/HST becomes payable on the day the purchaser makes the payment or on the day the payment becomes due under the terms of the contract (for example, 10 days after the certificate is issued), whichever day is earlier.</p>
        <h4>When you cannot establish the value</h4>
        <p>When it is not possible to establish the value of all or part of a payment that is due on a particular day, the GST/HST is payable on the part of the payment for which the value can be determined on that day.</p>
        <p>For all or part of the payment that you cannot establish the value on the particular day, the GST/HST becomes payable on the day you can establish the value of the payment or the remaining part of the payment.</p>

        <p>A holdback occurs when a person purchases goods or services and keeps part of the payment until they are satisfied with the condition of the goods or the performance of the service.</p>
        <p>If, in accordance with federal or provincial law or a written agreement for the construction, renovation, alteration or repair of real property, a purchaser keeps a part of a payment as a holdback until the work is satisfactorily done, the GST/HST on the holdback amount becomes payable on the <strong>earlier</strong> of:</p>

          <li>the day the purchaser pays you the amount of the holdback</li>
          <li>the day the holdback period expires</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The GST/HST is collectible by you on the earlier of the above dates, even if you already issued an invoice and charged the GST/HST for the holdback amount.</p>
        <p>The general rule on when the GST/HST becomes payable applies if there is no holdback provision in federal or provincial law or a written agreement for the construction, renovation or alteration of, or repair to, real property. The general rule also applies if the purchaser pays the full amount and does not keep a part of the payment as a holdback, even if the written agreement or federal or provincial law allows them to do so.</p>

        <p><strong>Situation 1</strong> – If the value of one element can reasonably be seen as exceeding the value of each of the other elements, for the purpose of determining when tax becomes payable, the combined supply is considered to be a supply of that element.</p>
        <p>For example, if a sale includes real property and certain goods, and it is reasonable to conclude that the value of the&nbsp;real property exceeds the value of each good, then the entire sale is considered to be a sale of real property for the purpose of determining when the tax becomes payable.</p>

    <h2 id="determine">Determining if the vendor or purchaser collects and remits the GST/HST</h2>
    <p>If you make a taxable sale of real property, you generally have to charge and collect the tax on the sale, <strong>even if you are not registered for the GST/HST</strong>. However, in some cases, the purchaser has to pay the tax directly to the CRA instead of paying it to you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you are the vendor, do <strong>not</strong> collect the GST/HST in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The purchaser is registered for the GST/HST
        <ul>
          <li>This rule does not apply if you make a taxable sale of housing to an individual who is registered for the GST/HST. In this case, you must collect the tax from the individual</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You are a non-resident of Canada, even if you are considered to have a permanent establishment in Canada and be resident of Canada only for the activities carried on through that establishment. For more information on whether you are a non-resident person who has a permanent establishment in Canada, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/p-208r.html">GST/HST Policy Statement P-208R, Meaning of &quot;Permanent Establishment&quot; in Subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act (the Act)</a></li>
      <li>You and the purchaser made an election using election type 2 on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst22.html">Form GST22, Real Property – Election to Make Certain Sales Taxable</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not have to collect the tax on your taxable sale of real property because one of these cases applies, the purchaser has to report and pay the tax directly to the CRA.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The information under this heading does not apply if you are considered to have made a self-supply.</p>

  <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3>Vendor collects and remits the tax</h3>
    <p>If you are a vendor who has to collect and remit the tax due on your taxable sale of real property, you must account for the tax as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are a GST/HST registrant, include the GST/HST collectible on your regular GST/HST return for the reporting period when the GST/HST became collectible (in your <strong>line 105</strong> calculation if you file electronically or on <strong>line 103</strong> if you file a paper GST/HST return)</li>
      <li>If you are <strong>not</strong> a GST/HST registrant, report the tax collectible on<strong> line 103</strong> of Form GST62, Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return (Non-personalized). File this return by the end of the month following the month the tax became collectible and remit the net tax due with that return. Form GST62 is available only in pre-printed format, which you must order from the CRA. To do this, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/request-payment-forms-remittance-vouchers.html">Order remittance vouchers or payment forms</a></li>

    <h3>Purchaser pays tax directly to CRA</h3>
    <p>If you are a purchaser who has to pay the tax on your purchase of real property directly to the CRA, you must account for the tax as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>if you are a GST/HST registrant and will use or supply the real property:&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li><strong>more than 50%</strong> in your commercial activities, report the tax due on <strong>line 205</strong> (GST/HST due on the purchase of real property or purchase of emission allowances) of your GST/HST return for the reporting period in which the tax became payable and remit any positive amount of tax due for that return</li>
          <li><strong>50% or less</strong> in your commercial activities, report the tax due on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst60.html">Form GST60, GST/HST Return for Purchase of Real Property or Carbon Emission Allowances</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>if you are <strong>not</strong> a GST/HST registrant, report the tax due on Form GST60</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When using Form GST60 to report the tax due, you have to file this return by the end of the month following the month in which the tax became payable and pay the tax due with that return.</p>

    <h3>GST/HST registrants</h3>
    <p>As a GST/HST registrant, you have to file regular GST/HST returns, according to your reporting period, to report the tax you have to charge and collect on your taxable supplies. You also claim any ITCs for which you are eligible on your GST/HST return.</p>
    <p>Builders must use GST/HST NETFILE to file their returns for reporting periods when they paid or credited the amount of the GST/HST new housing rebate to the purchaser.</p>
    <p>Builders may also be required to electronically file their GST/HST returns for other reasons.
